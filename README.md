Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!


# About # 
I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Data and Discourse Studies at TU Darmstadt. I combine my passion for linguistics and digital humanities with practical skills in data analysis. I work with tools like SQL, Power BI, and Excel to explore and visualize data. For data annotation, I use INCEpTION. I use Python mainly to handle and organize data as well as to automate repetitive tasks, making my work more efficient. I’m comfortable working in Visual Studio Code, Google Colab, and Jupyter Notebook to support these activities.

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.
